   Heart Diagram [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Heart_diagram-en.svg]
*** Systde
    Makes muscule contrradcut, causes muscule to
*** Distde
** Misc
   Need oxygen to break down glucose to make ATP
* 4-1
** Major Determinants of Disease
   Most heart disease is the result of atherosclerotic obstruction of the coronary arteries.
   Congestive heart failure is mechanical failure of the heart to eject blood delievered to it.
   Metabolic or autoimmune disease may cause heart muscle or valve damage.
   High blood press accelerates atheorosclerosis and most other cardiac disease.
   Cardiac valves are suspectibile to change.
   Abnormal embryonic development of the heart produces significant cardiac anatomic malformations.
   Abnormal heartbeat patterns (arrhythmias) can cause heart problems
** Arrhythmias
   Mechanically inefficient
    -CO decreases
   Potentially fatal
   Normal rhythm is ~70
   tachycardia is > 100
   bradycardia is < 60
*** Caused by
    myocardialschemia
    MI
    electrolyte imbalance
    stress
    caffeine
    drugs, especially stimulants
    congenital defects in the electrical network.
    
* 4-3
** Arrhythmias(cont.)
*** Premature atrial contractions
    extra atrial beats
    common in healthy people
    not harmful
    due to
      -stress
      -lack of sleep
      -caffeine
      -some drugs
*** Atrial flutter
    rapid, regular atrial rhythm
    ~300 beat/min
*** Atrial fibrillation
    rapid,irregular atrial rhythm
    AV node fodes out
** Heart Block
   Atrial signal is delayed & cannot cross into the ventricle
   Common cause is anatomic abnormalities
   Can also be caused by digitalis
*** 1st degree
    delay of signal but no missed ventricular beats

*** 2nd degree
    delay long enough to cause missed ventricular beats
    
*** 3rd degree
    total block of atrial signal
    decreased CO
    
** Permature ventricular contractions
   occur in healthy people
   chest palipations & anxiety
** Ventricular tachycardia
   spontaneous, regular beating at > 120 beats/min, decreased CO
** Ventricular fibrillation
   extremely rapid & irregular
   neglibile CO
* 4-4
** Congestive Heart Failure(CHF)
   Heart unable to eject  volume of blood delivered to it
   Endpoint for coronary atherosclerosis
   HTN
   Valve Disease
   Cardiomyopathy
   Congenital Cardiac malformations
   Affects about 1% of Americans
   1/2 dies within 5 years
   Most common cause is cardiac muscle damage usually due to CAD
   Less commonly due to valve defects
   Heart tries to compensate for either of these by increasing HR & force of contraction & through cardiac muscle hypertrophy.
   In L ventricular failure, low CO causes systemic hypoperfusion & pulmonary venous congestion. Causes back up in Left Atrium and then lungs
   In R ventricular failure, low CO causes systemic venous congestion
   The most common cause of R heart failure is L heart failure
   The low CO of L heart failure reduces renal blood flow which stimulates the renin-angestural.
** L Heart Failure
   L ventricle dilates
   Forward component
   decreased oxygen
** R Heart Failure
   R ventricle dilates
   Forward component
   -decreased blood flow to lungs
   Backward component
   systemic venous congestion
   congestion of liver,spleen
   edema in feet
   ascites
   Found with pulmonary HTN(known as cor pulmonale)
   
** Coronary Artery Disease
   CAD
   Almost all from atherosclerosis narrowing or complete obstruction
   Depending on the degree & character of obstruction
   angina pectoris
   MI 
   sudden  cardiac death
   chronic ischemic heart disease with CHF
* 4-7
** Angina Pectoris
   
** Myocardial Infarction
   MI
   Area of necrosis caused by ischemia
   Most common cause of death in industrialized nations
   Most initiated by plague disruption & accompanying thrombosis.
   Size of infarct determined by vessel involved
   Age of infarct determined by gross & microscopic findings.
    -coagulative necrosis early
    -development of granulation tissue
    -Mature scar
   What's the progression of high altitude sickness
* 4-23
** Arteriosclerosis
   Widening or contractions of arteries.
   A disease of intima
   Atheromas, atheromatous/fibrofatty plaques, fibrous plaques
   Narrowing of plagues, weakening of veins
*** Three patterns
**** Atherosclerosis
     The dominant pattern of arteriosclerosis
     Primarily affects the elastic(aorta, carotid,iliac) and large to medium sized muscular arteries(coronary,popliteal-behind the kneecap)
**** Medial calcific sclerosis
**** Arteriolosclerosis
     small arteries and aterioles(hypertension and DM)
     
*** Non-Modifiable Risk Factors
**** Age
     Dominant Influence
     Atherosclerosis begins in the youth, but does not precipitate organ injury later in life
**** Gender
     Men more prone than woman, but by age 60-70 about equal frequency. (Although that's changing)
**** Family History
     If past family members have heart disease, more prone to it

    Refer to A
